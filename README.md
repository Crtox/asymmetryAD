## 📖 Project Overview

**asymmetryAD** is a Python-based project focused on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research. This repository contains code and results generated during my work at the **Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research (WIMR)** in Madison, WI. The project runs from **September 2nd to November 18th, 2024**.

## 🔍 Research Goals

1. **Validate Results**: 
   - Reproduce and evaluate findings from previous studies on new data.
   
2. **Biomarker Development**:
   - Investigate and design new biomarkers to detect asymmetry in Alzheimer's Disease, potentially offering more robust diagnostic tools.

3. **Result correlation**:
   - Correlate physician’s observations in asymmetry with freshly produces results

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: 
   - `numpy`, `scipy`, `nibabel`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, etc.
   - Specialized packages for medical image processing and statistical analysis.
